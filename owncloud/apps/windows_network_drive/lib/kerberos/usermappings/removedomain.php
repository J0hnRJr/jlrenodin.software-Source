 * For example, if the uid is "myuser@my.comp.eu", only "myuser" will be returned
 *
 * This mapping won't do anything if the if there is no "@" char in the uid.

 * This mapping can be used if the user_ldap app is used with "userPrincipalName"

 * If kerberos is used as authentication against ownCloud (with the kerberos app),
 * we might get uids such as "myuser@OC.SRV.COM"
