<h2>Software Engineering</h2>
<p>
    In the journey of my studies, I have been introduced to many of the modern languages used to build the software being 
    used in today's architecture. I have worked with both front-end and back-end technologies. I have even worked from 
    small one hour project to full greater than 160-hour projects both on my own and working with a team. These include a 
    capstone project for Liberty University and the work I performed for Nuday Tuday to help create the Treasure Hunt 
    Challenge App.

<h2>Leadership</h2>
<p>
    After many years of working in various warehouse settings, I was informed of an opening as a Warehouse Lead at Accredo 
    Health Group Inc. I decided to apply and was given the opportunity to help lead a team, directing and instructing a 
    group of over 10 individuals. This was a great chance to learn about how leaders think and what they expect from those 
    that are following their direction. After leading for two years I decided it was time to focus on my studies and step 
    down from leadership.

<h2>Warehousing and Logistics</h2>
<p>
    I have over 9 years of experience in various logistical and warehouse environments with 8 of those being in warehouses.
    Stocking, receiving, shipping, returning to stock, and staging are some of the tasks I became extremely familiar with 
    while working in these locations.
